# Complexity-Resources
From Basic to Advanced. Complex does not equal complicated, a computer for example is complicated, whereas the brain is complex. Complexity is a property of the systems as a whole. The science of complexity takes a global view of the world, it regards the interrelations between systems and the elements that they are made up of. This hollistic apporach is deterministic but nonreductionistic.

## Basics in Complexity:
Butterﬂy effect: even initial situations that are very close to one another may present a difference that becomes sizeable over time, this property is called sensitivity to initial conditions. Improving the precision of measurement can to some extend increase the so-called predictability horizon, but errors introduced by using approximations increasingly amplify themself. Unstable dynamical systems are characterized by the unpredictability this effect causes. This is called deterministic chaos, it is the substantial and intrinsic unpredictability of the future evolution of both a real system and an abstract model.

### Computation
What does computing mean?
- Neural computation
- collective computation (swarm intelligence)
- nature-inspired computation (e.g. immune system)
- evolutionary computing (https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/evco)

### Math:
Phase space, orbit, basin of attraction and attractor are all mathematical concepts and as such abstract models constructed from observed processes. 

- graph theory (math)
- network theory 

The Lyapunov exponents provides a measurment of the stability of a dynamical system, they quantify the level of chaos by indicating the speed of growth (instability) or reduction (stability). The sum of these exponents known as the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy it is an indicator of the extent to which the system is unpredictable (the higher, the less predictable).

### Applied complexity research
Economies are self-organizing systems they are dealing with dynamic, changing systems, in which positive feedbacks are involved (stock market). Social systems in general are instable and very often 'situations' are different from each other, which makes the determination of regularities difficult.

### Computational modeling
'What I cannot create, I do not understand.' - Richard Feynman

Mathematical modelling has become an increasingly relevant instrument, reality often turns out too complicated to be summarized within a limited set of rules. Especially the assumptions underlying linearization are unacceptable, the further a phenomen is from a condition of stable equilibrium. Nonlinear models are often better suited, but they are limited due to incomplete knowledge of the initial state leading to approximations that worsen over time.

A model, intrinsically, is a partial representation of several aspects of reality, it remains only a tool of analysis, even though a fundamental one. To build such models it is important to identify the number of state variable need to constitute the phase space to contain the possible attractor (an the dimension of such). The number of state variables is often numerous and usually even impossible to identify.

All sciences have the identification and prediction of the evolution of systems over time in common, for this purpose modeling is well suited.
